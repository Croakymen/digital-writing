###### i vow to do the thing
# i will write stuff

# been listening to a lot of the doors lately
# really want to create a sort of work inspired by the desert imagery, in twine or inform7 format
# a wild west text adventure perhaps
# following on from the assignment one case studies, a big topic is pacing.
# i think speeding the game up for a gun duel could be really smart use of medium.
# working at aldi and having to type in product codes extremely fast is reminiscent of typing literacy software
# text inputs would deal damage according to the number of characters
# type 'shoot' instead of 'fan' for accuracy

# travel the wilds learning new and powerful verbs
# the meanest vaquero in the wasteland has a WPM of 121

#21/3/23:
# i quite like the idea if using onomatopoeia as the dialogue options
# makes things very visual and is reminiscent of the long tradition of wild west comics

# 27/3/23: 
# twine seems to be very useful software to create piece inside of
#image formatting seems a little difficult however
#I was interested in using images a lot so i might take a cue from dwarf fortress and use text graphics
#there is probably a site online to convert .SVG to text graphics or something

#bitsy is a good candidate to employ ludic aspects within a work
#whether it is possible to combine with twine text is yet to be seen
- it could have some issues in terms of loading times
- it could habe some issues with multiple branches since all twine code is on a single page

#might need to do traditional html links for options in order to have multiple bitsy files for each choice
#isometric bitsy graphics maybe

#21/4/23
#as task two approaches it becomes more and more apparent that bitsy is too rigid in its aesthetic sensibility.
#Currently, it seems a twine using GIFs is the best choice. They seem to load ok thus far.

#24/4/23
#I have mocked up a draft map for the presentation, which is a small fishing village.
#Though demonstration of GIF in twine went well proving concept, I must now focus on organising story
#I think this fishing village may prove to be too isolated for a dynamic story to take place in

#Been looking at a lot of photography journals of Pablo Lopez Luz, and his series on hotels and resorts.
#Might keep the missing shoes story, change the setting to luxury resort
#This is my strong suit as making procedural music on latin themes is easy

#3/5/23
#It is becoming apparent that Harlowe is disappointingly inflexible in its image formatting
#I seem unable to use an image as a selectable option
#I may just be bad with code
#If I had more time, I would have been very interested in sugarcube story format, as CSS likely has more freedom

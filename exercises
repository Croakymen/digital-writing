### what tools or techniques do you use??

i use procreate, or adobe illustrator to map out narrative. 
i use a desktop computer with dual monitors to be able to refer to material extensively. 
when brainstorming i will sit against a wall anduse a journal or tablet

## why do you use these tools

i often use a digital canvas to write so i can easily link things in a way that is not linear.
same goes for hand writing. 
things travel in many directions so one cannot easily organise it.
sitting ag8nst a wall assures i am not too comfortable, encouraging a level of focus

### how do these tools ## shape the way you write

these two methods allow me to match a style to my mood or motivation
with differing levels of profession

### Week 5

 - How is hypertext different from fiction?
	 I would describe hypertext as a distinct subset of fiction, where the form of the narrative is now also affected
	 by complexity. Standard fiction has a form that does not change.
